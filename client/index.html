      <h1>About the Game</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Will's Game is an online multiplayer first-person shooter built with HTML and JavaScript. It uses Three JS to render the map, Node JS and Socket.io
        to create a server that allows multiple players on different browsers, and is hosted on Heroku's Cloud Application Platform. </h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">After entering a name and selecting the Play Will's Game button you will spawn in at a random location on the map.
      If you click the screen it will grab your mouse and allow you to look around, to release the mouse hit the 'esc' key. Use 'WASD' to move, 'space' to jump, and 'left shift'
      to sprint. You can use the arrow keys to move the GUI to the corners of the screen. Click the mouse to shoot, you have 7 bullets in each magazine with an unlimited amount of reloads.
      Hit 'r' to reload which will take three seconds and
      you will be unable to shoot in that time. Your kills and deaths are displayed in the bottom left along with the number of active players, and your ammunition is displayed in the
      bottom right. The leaderboard in the top right will show you the top three players among active users by number of kills.</p>
